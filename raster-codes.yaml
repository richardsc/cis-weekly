  variables:

  - column: E_CT

    notes: Ratio of ice to water area expressed in tenths.

  - column: E_CA
    symbol: Ca
    definition: Partial concentration (thickest)
    notes: Ratio of ice to water area expressed in tenths. If only one ice type is present,
      no value will appear here and is assumed to be equal to Ct.

  - column: E_CB
    symbol: Cb
    definition: Partial concentration (2nd thickest)
    notes: Ratio of ice to water area expressed in tenths.

  - column: E_CC

    notes: Ratio of ice to water area expressed in tenths.

  - column: E_CD
    symbol: Cd
